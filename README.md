#Hi, Iâ€™m Rishi

##I'm a full stack web developer.

I have mostly worked with MERN stack, although i try to keep adding something to my skillset all the time, I keep the window open for all tech and tools.

My skillset:

  => html, css, javascript,
  
  => Node.js, express, mongodb
  
  => React, Redux
  
  => Bootstrap
  
  => I know some other stuff like Sass, Semantic UI, Adobe Illustrator, C++.

Want to collaborate? I'm ready to get my hands dirty (in development ofcourse).
